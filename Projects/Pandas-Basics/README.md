# Pandas Basics Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates comprehensive Pandas functionality for data manipulation and analysis using a simulated sales dataset. It covers all essential Pandas operations from basic DataFrame creation to advanced data analysis techniques.

## Features
- **Data Creation**: Generate realistic sample datasets with multiple data types
- **DataFrame Operations**: Basic info, statistics, and data exploration
- **Data Selection**: Various methods to select and filter data
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, duplicates, and data type conversions
- **Data Aggregation**: Group by operations and statistical summaries
- **Data Manipulation**: Sorting, ranking, pivot tables, and cross-tabulations
- **Data Merging**: Join and concatenate multiple datasets
- **Data I/O**: Save and load data in various formats

## Files
- `pandas_operations.py` - Comprehensive demonstration of Pandas functionality

## Requirements
- Pandas
- NumPy

## Usage
```bash
python pandas_operations.py
```

## Sample Dataset
The script creates a simulated sales dataset with the following features:
- **Date**: Daily sales records over 100 days
- **Product**: Electronics items (Laptop, Phone, Tablet, Desktop, Monitor)
- **Category**: Product categories
- **Sales_Amount**: Transaction amounts with realistic variation
- **Quantity**: Number of items sold
- **Region**: Geographic sales regions
- **Customer_Age**: Customer demographic data
- **Customer_Satisfaction**: Rating scores (with some missing values for cleaning demo)

## Learning Objectives
After running this project, you will understand:
- How to create and explore DataFrames effectively
- Data selection and filtering techniques
- Data cleaning and preprocessing workflows
- Aggregation and grouping for data analysis
- Advanced data manipulation operations
- Merging and joining datasets
- Data input/output operations

## Key Demonstrations
1. **Basic Operations**: DataFrame info, statistics, and data types
2. **Selection & Filtering**: Column/row selection, conditional filtering
3. **Data Cleaning**: Missing value handling, duplicate removal, type conversion
4. **Aggregation**: Group by operations, custom aggregations, statistical summaries
5. **Manipulation**: Sorting, ranking, pivot tables, binning
6. **Merging**: Inner/left joins, concatenation
7. **I/O Operations**: CSV and JSON export/import
